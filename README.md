# The Ultimate Google Command Line Interface

Inspired by [google-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-cli) npm package, which do the job, but too slow and has some issues (from my perspective).

## Usage

````shell
google something funny
````

## Instalation

### Windows:
Run install.bat **as Adminsitrator** or just
Copy [google.bat](https://github.com/a13ks3y/google-cli/raw/master/google.bat) to your PATH directory, reload terminal.

### Other OS:
